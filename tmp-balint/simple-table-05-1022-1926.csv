These lists describe the expected species composition of each NiN type in its natural (reference) state (Halvorsen et al. 2015), and is calculated for each NIN type by multiplying species’ abundance values with its indicator value, adding these values and then dividing by the sum of the amounts. Bootstrapping was used to calculate the potential uncertainty in generalised species lists: each species list was resampled 10 000 times, and in each round, 1/3 of the species in the species list was randomly sampled. Dominant key species in the ecosystem, i.e., species with abundance values ≥ 6 on a scale from 1-6 were included in each selection. The average indicator value for each bootstrap was calculated, and a density distribution across indicator values was produced as a reference distribution. See Töpper et al. 2018 for more details. The following changes were made to the methodology: Re-sampling 1/3 of the species in the species list instead of 2/3, based on species richness documented in ANO. Using mandatory species with abundance value ≥ 6 instead of ≥ 4 in every sample. The reference distribution is unique to each mapping unit at a scale of 1:5000 in T4 non-wetland forest and T30 riparian forest. | The reference value is reported as the median of the reference distribution."

This relationship is assumed to apply to all mountain areas, including domestic reindeer areas and mountain areas currently without reindeer. The total reference population for wild reindeer can be calculated given the area of the mountain areas and the areas' average TRI values. In addition, we have assumed that natural populations of large predators will lead to a somewhat lower density in the reference condition than is specified for the management targets given in Kjørstad et al. (2017). The reference density given by the formula above is therefore reduced by 25%. This is a two-sided indicator, where both low and high reindeer populations can indicate a deviation from the reference condition. Lower and upper limit values have therefore been determined for the indicator, given as 60% and 200% of the reference value, respectively. An asymmetric scaling function is based on the assumption that lower densities have greater effects on the ecosystem than higher densities."

Larger contiguous natural areas are important as habitats and migration corridors for species, especially those that are adapted to large areas that are in or close to their natural state, as well as species that are particularly vulnerable to edge effects or other disturbances. Intact nature is also important for nature's ability to adapt to climate change, e.g., infrastructure creates additional barriers for the movement of species to areas with more suitable climates. However, the importance of intact nature for biodiversity will also depend on other impacts on the ecosystem. How much the proportion of intact nature can be reduced before there are negative effects on ecological condition depends on several factors, e.g., how large the area is in the first place, how the loss of intact nature is distributed, and the natural degree of fragmentation for the relevant ecosystem in the region. Various studies indicate that fragmentation that reduces the original area down to 20-40% will have a greater negative effect on affected species than a reduction in habitat alone would suggest. If we assume that this represents a boundary between moderate and poor condition, and that the relationship between the indicator and ecological condition is linear down to this boundary, the limit value for good condition can be set to 60% of the reference value.

Bootstrapping was used to calculate the potential uncertainty in generalised species lists: each species list was resampled 10 000 times, and in each round, 1/3 of the species in the species list was randomly sampled. Dominant key species in the ecosystem, i.e., species with abundance values ≥ 6 on a scale from 1-6 were included in each selection. The average indicator value for each bootstrap was calculated, and a density distribution across indicator values was produced as a reference distribution. See Töpper et al. 2018 for more details. The following changes were made to the methodology: Re-sampling 1/3 of the species in the species list instead of 2/3, based on species richness documented in ANO. Using mandatory species with abundance value ≥ 6 instead of ≥ 4 in every sample. The reference distribution is unique to each mapping unit at a scale of 1:5000 in T4 non-wetland forest and T30 riparian forest. | The reference value is reported as the median of the reference distribution."

Larger contiguous natural areas are important as habitats and migration corridors for species, especially those that are adapted to large areas that are in or close to their natural state, as well as species that are particularly vulnerable to edge effects or other disturbances. Intact nature is also important for nature's ability to adapt to climate change, e.g., infrastructure creates additional barriers for the movement of species to areas with more suitable climates. However, the importance of intact nature for biodiversity will also depend on other impacts on the ecosystem. How much the proportion of intact nature can be reduced before there are negative effects on ecological condition depends on several factors, e.g., how large the area is in the first place, how the loss of intact nature is distributed, and the natural degree of fragmentation for the relevant ecosystem in the region. Various studies indicate that fragmentation that reduces the original area down to 20-40% will have a greater negative effect on affected species than a reduction in habitat alone would suggest. If we assume that this represents a boundary between moderate and poor condition, and that the relationship between the indicator and ecological condition is linear down to this boundary, the limit value for good condition can be set to 60% of the reference value. Also see the reasoning in chapter 3.2 and 4.1 in Nybø et al. 2018."

Bootstrapping was used to calculate the potential uncertainty in generalised species lists: each species list was resampled 10 000 times, and in each round, 1/3 of the species in the species list was randomly sampled. Dominant key species in the ecosystem, i.e., species with abundance values ≥ 6 on a scale from 1-6 were included in each selection. The average indicator value for each bootstrap was calculated, and a density distribution across indicator values was produced as a reference distribution. See Töpper et al. 2018 for more details. The following changes were made to the methodology: Re-sampling 1/3 of the species in the species list instead of 2/3, based on species richness documented in ANO. Using mandatory species with abundance value ≥ 6 instead of ≥ 4 in every sample. The reference distribution is unique to each mapping unit at a scale of 1:5000 in T4 non-wetland forest and T30 riparian forest. | The reference value is reported as the median of the reference distribution."

This relationship is assumed to apply to all mountain areas, including domestic reindeer areas and mountain areas currently without reindeer. The total reference population for wild reindeer can be calculated given the area of the mountain areas and the areas' average TRI values.

(2017). The reference density given by the formula above is therefore reduced by 25%. This is a two-sided indicator, where both low and high reindeer populations can indicate a deviation from the reference condition. Lower and upper limit values have therefore been determined for the indicator, given as 60% and 200% of the reference value, respectively. An asymmetric scaling function is based on the assumption that lower densities have greater effects on the ecosystem than higher densities."

Alternative approaches should be considered, especially in light of possible updated data (cf. Nybø et al. 2018, Framstad et al. 2021). ## r.opt: Empirically supported expert knowledge: Demography + habitat availability models. Reference values for elk and red deer in the Norwegian Nature Index 2020 are estimated as the number of individuals per km2 under the climatic treeline for each county. These reference values are calculated based on the amount of suitable area and potential density per species given natural populations of large predators. The reference values ​​reported for the indicators in the Norwegian Nature Index are also used for the assessment of ecological condition (www.naturindeks.no). Following the simplified approach described in Nybø et al. (2018; chapter 3.2 and 6.3), the lower limit for good condition is set to a 0,6* the reference value. An upper limit value is applied for cervid populations that are so large that they can have harmful effects on the vegetation."

Larger contiguous natural areas are important as habitats and migration corridors for species, especially those that are adapted to large areas that are in or close to their natural state, as well as species that are particularly vulnerable to edge effects or other disturbances. Intact nature is also important for nature's ability to adapt to climate change, e.g., infrastructure creates additional barriers for the movement of species to areas with more suitable climates. However, the importance of intact nature for biodiversity will also depend on other impacts on the ecosystem. How much the proportion of intact nature can be reduced before there are negative effects on ecological condition depends on several factors, e.g., how large the area is in the first place, how the loss of intact nature is distributed, and the natural degree of fragmentation for the relevant ecosystem in the region. Various studies indicate that fragmentation that reduces the original area down to 20-40% will have a greater negative effect on affected species than a reduction in habitat alone would suggest. If we assume that this represents a boundary between moderate and poor condition, and that the relationship between the indicator and ecological condition is linear down to this boundary, the limit value for good condition can be set to 60% of the reference value.

Bootstrapping was used to calculate the potential uncertainty in generalised species lists: each species list was resampled 10 000 times, and in each round, 1/3 of the species in the species list was randomly sampled. Dominant key species in the ecosystem, i.e., species with abundance values ≥ 6 on a scale from 1-6 were included in each selection. The average indicator value for each bootstrap was calculated, and a density distribution across indicator values was produced as a reference distribution. See Töpper et al. 2018 for more details. The following changes were made to the methodology: Re-sampling 1/3 of the species in the species list instead of 2/3, based on species richness documented in ANO. Using mandatory species with abundance value ≥ 6 instead of ≥ 4 in every sample. The reference distribution is unique to each mapping unit at a scale of 1:5000 in T4 non-wetland forest and T30 riparian forest. | The reference value is reported as the median of the reference distribution."

This relationship is assumed to apply to all mountain areas, including domestic reindeer areas and mountain areas currently without reindeer. The total reference population for wild reindeer can be calculated given the area of the mountain areas and the areas' average TRI values. In addition, we have assumed that natural populations of large predators will lead to a somewhat lower density in the reference condition than is specified for the management targets given in Kjørstad et al. (2017). The reference density given by the formula above is therefore reduced by 25%.

Intact nature is also important for nature's ability to adapt to climate change, e.g., infrastructure creates additional barriers for the movement of species to areas with more suitable climates. However, the importance of intact nature for biodiversity will also depend on other impacts on the ecosystem. How much the proportion of intact nature can be reduced before there are negative effects on ecological condition depends on several factors, e.g., how large the area is in the first place, how the loss of intact nature is distributed, and the natural degree of fragmentation for the relevant ecosystem in the region. Various studies indicate that fragmentation that reduces the original area down to 20-40% will have a greater negative effect on affected species than a reduction in habitat alone would suggest.

These lists describe the expected species composition of each NiN type in its natural (reference) state (Halvorsen et al. 2015), and is calculated for each NIN type by multiplying species’ abundance values with its indicator value, adding these values and then dividing by the sum of the amounts. Bootstrapping was used to calculate the potential uncertainty in generalised species lists: each species list was resampled 10 000 times, and in each round, 1/3 of the species in the species list was randomly sampled. Dominant key species in the ecosystem, i.e., species with abundance values ≥ 6 on a scale from 1-6 were included in each selection. The average indicator value for each bootstrap was calculated, and a density distribution across indicator values was produced as a reference distribution. See Töpper et al. 2018 for more details. The following changes were made to the methodology: Re-sampling 1/3 of the species in the species list instead of 2/3, based on species richness documented in ANO. Using mandatory species with abundance value ≥ 6 instead of ≥ 4 in every sample. The reference distribution is unique to each mapping unit at a scale of 1:5000 in T4 non-wetland forest and T30 riparian forest. | The reference value is reported as the median of the reference distribution."

This relationship is assumed to apply to all mountain areas, including domestic reindeer areas and mountain areas currently without reindeer. The total reference population for wild reindeer can be calculated given the area of the mountain areas and the areas' average TRI values. In addition, we have assumed that natural populations of large predators will lead to a somewhat lower density in the reference condition than is specified for the management targets given in Kjørstad et al. (2017). The reference density given by the formula above is therefore reduced by 25%. This is a two-sided indicator, where both low and high reindeer populations can indicate a deviation from the reference condition. Lower and upper limit values have therefore been determined for the indicator, given as 60% and 200% of the reference value, respectively. An asymmetric scaling function is based on the assumption that lower densities have greater effects on the ecosystem than higher densities."

These lists describe the expected species composition of each NiN type in its natural (reference) state (Halvorsen et al. 2015), and is calculated for each NIN type by multiplying species’ abundance values with its indicator value, adding these values and then dividing by the sum of the amounts. Bootstrapping was used to calculate the potential uncertainty in generalised species lists: each species list was resampled 10 000 times, and in each round, 1/3 of the species in the species list was randomly sampled. Dominant key species in the ecosystem, i.e., species with abundance values ≥ 6 on a scale from 1-6 were included in each selection. The average indicator value for each bootstrap was calculated, and a density distribution across indicator values was produced as a reference distribution. See Töpper et al. 2018 for more details. The following changes were made to the methodology: Re-sampling 1/3 of the species in the species list instead of 2/3, based on species richness documented in ANO. Using mandatory species with abundance value ≥ 6 instead of ≥ 4 in every sample.

This relationship is assumed to apply to all mountain areas, including domestic reindeer areas and mountain areas currently without reindeer. The total reference population for wild reindeer can be calculated given the area of the mountain areas and the areas' average TRI values. In addition, we have assumed that natural populations of large predators will lead to a somewhat lower density in the reference condition than is specified for the management targets given in Kjørstad et al. (2017). The reference density given by the formula above is therefore reduced by 25%. This is a two-sided indicator, where both low and high reindeer populations can indicate a deviation from the reference condition. Lower and upper limit values have therefore been determined for the indicator, given as 60% and 200% of the reference value, respectively. An asymmetric scaling function is based on the assumption that lower densities have greater effects on the ecosystem than higher densities."

Intact nature is also important for nature's ability to adapt to climate change, e.g., infrastructure creates additional barriers for the movement of species to areas with more suitable climates. However, the importance of intact nature for biodiversity will also depend on other impacts on the ecosystem. How much the proportion of intact nature can be reduced before there are negative effects on ecological condition depends on several factors, e.g., how large the area is in the first place, how the loss of intact nature is distributed, and the natural degree of fragmentation for the relevant ecosystem in the region. Various studies indicate that fragmentation that reduces the original area down to 20-40% will have a greater negative effect on affected species than a reduction in habitat alone would suggest. If we assume that this represents a boundary between moderate and poor condition, and that the relationship between the indicator and ecological condition is linear down to this boundary, the limit value for good condition can be set to 60% of the reference value.

Bootstrapping was used to calculate the potential uncertainty in generalised species lists: each species list was resampled 10 000 times, and in each round, 1/3 of the species in the species list was randomly sampled. Dominant key species in the ecosystem, i.e., species with abundance values ≥ 6 on a scale from 1-6 were included in each selection. The average indicator value for each bootstrap was calculated, and a density distribution across indicator values was produced as a reference distribution. See Töpper et al. 2018 for more details. The following changes were made to the methodology: Re-sampling 1/3 of the species in the species list instead of 2/3, based on species richness documented in ANO. Using mandatory species with abundance value ≥ 6 instead of ≥ 4 in every sample.
